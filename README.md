Math Game
======
Equations are coming to the base! Solve them to hold them off for as long as possible.

# How To Play
This game is similiar to Quizlet's Space Race game. You start with 10 lives. If you enter a wrong number, you lose a life. If an equation makes it to the end, you lose 2 lives. Solving equations by entering a value for one of the X values grants points depending on the difficulty of the equation. 

# Mechanics
With each level, the more challenging equations have a higher chance of spawning, and each equation moves faster. Every few levels, a more challenging type of equation enters the spawning pool. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
